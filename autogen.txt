Apologies, let's take a step back.
I'd like to get the ball rolling on this project.
We need to prep for the executive reviews next weke.
Can we prioritize this project first?
Fundamentally, what do we believe our priorities to be?
What's the quintessential essence of this product?
What strengths can we leverage?
I just wanted to check in on the status of the project.
We should be making data-driven decisions.
Can we analyze the decision-making process?
How can we achieve product-market fit?
Alright folks, it's crunch time!
Apologies, can we keep our eye on the prize?
Just briefly, what are the core principles we're operating under?
Let's go around the room. What reservations do you have?
Before we wrap up this meeting, can we wrap up our finalized decisions?
Do we have consensus on this project?
I think it's important to maintain a state of collaboration.
Can we get a hotfix in before then?
What's the ETA on that?
Shall I draft up a PRD?
What do we need to resolve before moving forward?
OK first, what are everyone's concerns?
Before we move forward on that, can we evaluate the downsides to this proposal?
Has anyone performed an analysis on this model?
Let me throw something on your calendar.
